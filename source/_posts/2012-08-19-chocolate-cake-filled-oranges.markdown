If you look at the right sidebar, there is a section called "On Delicious". [Delicious](http://www.delicious.com) is a web service that allows you to make bookmarks which are publicly accessible. It is a nice service, and it is nice to have my bookmarks accessible fron anywhere, and searchable by tags.

I recently came across these [chocolate cake-filled oranges](http://www.chow.com/galleries/315/step-up-the-smore-7-ideas-for-campfire-treats-by-chris-rochelle#!7324/chocolate-cake-baked-in-an-orange). I am looking forward to trying these in the near future. In this case, a truly delicious bookmark.
