I am a University of Washington student in the Operations Management PhD program. I am still identifying my exact area of research, and I am completely excited about the field as a whole. My previous research was in the area of finance and applied statistics.

My wife and I were married June 25th of 2011, and we recently celebrated the arrival of our son, Jeffrey!

My CV is located [here](http://steve.planetbarr.com/resume).
